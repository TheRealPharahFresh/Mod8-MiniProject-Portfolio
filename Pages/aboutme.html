                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <blockquote>I began my journey in music as a child, always passionate about creating new sounds and lyrics to craft my own songs—a passion that would last a lifetime. In 2012, I left my hometown of Americus, GA, to attend Full Sail University. During my time there, an A&R representative from a record label discovered me and pulled me from school, placing me directly into a studio to write for artists signed to the label. Little did I know, this would mark the beginning of my professional music career.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Fast forward two years, I moved back to Georgia from Florida and settled in Atlanta, where my older brothers opened their own studio, LoudHouse Studios. They gave me the incredible opportunity to utilize the studio to cultivate my talent and create new music. Through this experience, I built strong relationships with celebrity clients and established a successful career as a songwriter.</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>Although music remains my first love and a significant source of income, I’ve developed a deep passion for software engineering. I aspire to become a full-stack developer within 2-3 years or sooner. My ultimate goal is to create apps that support my music-related business ideas and merge my two greatest passions: music and technology.</blockquote>
